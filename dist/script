2. Thanks. (Sigh)
1. What’s up?
2. Nah.. just feeling stressed out.
1. Huh.. CMU student? 
2. Exactly. The school of CS nerds, haha.. 
2. I wish I am really passionate about CS and coding. 
2. But it seems like I am among the normal people who wish to have a personal life that 
2. involves no coding involved.
2. Turned out the course work has taken up all of my time and I couldn’t afford to 
2. have a chill Friday night until the midterm is over.
1. It sucks. What kind of course are you taking, man?
2. Really? I didn’t expect anyone would listen to a nerd's topic in a bar.
1. hah, try me, I miss my campus life today.
2. Okay.. So yeah, I am taking Game Programming. Sounds interesting huh? 
2. Of course it is, but the only thing that bothers me is that I keep feeling like 
2. I am not good enough for the school, you know.
2. At the end of the day, it’s CMU, not gonna be easy.
2. Like this week, you know, I just want to make a simple game, no fancy graphics, 
2. just a game with text and choices.
1. Like galgame?
2. Well yeah.. Kind of.. Except for there’s no cute girls.
1. Just text?
2. Yeah.
1. Wouldn’t be an easy one?
2. I thought it would be... Or it should, and I am just to dumb to figure it out quickly. 
2. You know, I just want to render some text on the screen, and it took me an entire day to finish it.
2. And rendering text is just the very first step of finishing the assignment... 
2. And I completed it on Sunday night while the due is Tuesday morning. it’s not fun.
