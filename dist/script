0. Carnegie Mellon is notorious for its heavy workload. 
0. Here, students are taught how to plan their life by the second, because what other way is there to live? 
0. The students learn a lot from the coursework, but at the price of their quality of life.
0. Some of them decide to devote themselves to studies. They often get overwhelmed. 
0. Some even develop smoking habits.
0. On a lovely street in Shadyside, a bar called Mario’s Saloon is where everyone eventually ends up at. 
0.
0. You see many students come in regularly.
0. You feel sad and empathetic, but it's great business for you. You aren't complaining.   
0. 
0. A visibly tired guy with heavy dark circles under his eyes sits down, defeated. 
0.
1. What can I get you buddy?
0. He looks up, red-eyed. 
2. Hey, can I get a shot and beer?
-2.
Give him a beer. 
Beer
Give him a whiskey shot with a beer. 
Shot and beer

Shot and beer
1. Thanks.
0. The guy downs the shot and chugs the beer. 
2. That was fast, you alright there?
1. Yeah! I'm great! 
0. He lays his head down on the counter and passes out. 
2. Well, looks like a CMU student. 
0. [End] 

Beer
2. Thanks. (Sigh)
1. What’s up?
2. Just stressed out, man.
1. Hmm... Let me guess, you're a CMU student? 
2. (Visibly surprised) Haha, you guessed right. I am a CS nerd. 
1. That's awesome, dude. You must be pretty damn smart. 
2. I guess so. The only time I felt smart was on day one. Until I met my peers. 
2. I'm surrounded by some pretty smart people. 
1. So, what's got you stressed out tonight? Are you waiting for anyone?
2. Nope. My friends are all tackling deadlines. I just finished one and decided to grab
2. a quick beer before starting working tonight.
1. You look prety exhausted man, don't you wanna sleep?
2. Haha, not tonight. Looking forward to a good night's sleep at Thanksgiving I guess. 
1. That sucks! Alright, let me know when you are up for a refill.  
2. Do you mind staying a minute to chat? I haven't talked to anyone in two days. 
-2.
Sure! What's on your mind?
GameProg
Sorry I have other things to do.
Go away

2. I understand, you're busy too. Just like everyone else.
-2.
Stay and talk.

2. Wow, I didn’t expect you would listen to a nerd's ranting in a bar.
1. ...
2. When I was a kid I would love playing video games. I still do, on my semester breaks. 
2. This semester, I felt like hey, why not learn how to make games? Sounds like a lot of fun!
2. Turns out, making games is a crap ton harder than playing them (laughs painfully).   
1. That's damn cool, man. This does sound like a lot of fun. What's got you so stressed?
2. The professor thinks I'm an expert at everything. 
2. It took me 3 days to understand what I need to do on an assignment. So much for being smart.  
1. (Smiles compassionately) 
2. Now, when I watch the trailer of a new game, all I think about is how stressful it must 
2. have been to develop it. 
1. Sounds like you made a good call coming here. You really needed a drink. 
-2. 
Give him a shot of whiskey. 
Whiskey shot
Wait for him to respond. 
Wait

Whiskey shot
2. (Smiles widely) Thanks for the shot! Seems like you read my mind. 
2. I shouldn't have too many, though. I don't wanna be drunk tonight. 
0. Dave does the shot, and winces slightly. He seems like a new drinker.
2. That felt great! Can I have another one? 
1. Take it easy there buddy. You can have another one later. Didn't you say you have to work?
2. Nah man. Screw the deadlines. I wanna get crap-faced tonight. 
-3. 
Give him another shot.  
Another shot
Say something kind.
kind words
Order a burger for him.
burger

Wait
2. I really don't know man. I don't wanna be drinking too much. But I don't wanna work either. 
1. Are you sure about that? Sounds like you need something stronger. 
2. ...
2. Alright, screw it! Please get me a shot of whiskey. 
0. Dave does the shot, and winces slightly. He seems like a new drinker.

Another shot
1. Here you go. I'd recommend a burger with that. Our kitchen makes a great burger. 
1. Should I get you one? 
2. That sounds great. I haven't eaten anything since breakfast. 
2. I was busy trying to get my stupid rat to stop going through walls. 
1. (Laugh) You're funny!
2. Yeah, I use humor to hide my pain. Didn't expect to learn this at CMU. 
1. You seem to be a great guy. I'm sure you will pull through. 
2. (Smiling slightly) I really wish that I didn't feel like I'm good enough for school, you know. 
2. It's not easy to survive here. Thanks for talking to me.  
0. And that's how you learned about the life at CMU. 
0. The students may be smart, but what they don't understand is that you hear the same story 
0. several times a week. They are all in the same boat, and they will all be fine. 
0. You find happiness in helping them through this one drink at a time. 
0. [End] 

burger
1. I think you need to eat first. Let me get you our famous burger instead. The shot can wait. 
2. (Disappointed) Okay. That doesn't sound too terrible. I think I'll head right back to work after. 
1. Sure. Let me get you that. 
1. You seem to be a great guy. I'm sure you will pull through. 
2. (Smiling slightly) I really wish that I didn't feel like I'm good enough for school, you know.
